# Open NPU

Open NPU is an open-source initiative aiming to develop a free and open neural processing unit (NPU) architecture, much like RISC-V has done for CPUs. Our goal is to provide a flexible, extensible, and community-driven platform for developing and deploying machine learning and artificial intelligence applications.

## Introduction

Open NPU aims to democratize access to high-performance neural processing by providing an open-source NPU architecture. By leveraging the collective expertise of the community, we strive to create a powerful and adaptable platform that meets the needs of various AI workloads.

## Features

- **Open Source**: Fully open-source under a permissive license.
- **Extensible**: Modular design allowing easy extensions and customizations.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for a variety of AI and ML tasks.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for a range of applications from edge devices to data centers.
- **Community-Driven**: Contributions from developers and researchers around the world.

## Architecture

Open NPU's architecture is designed to be flexible and scalable, featuring:

- **Modular Components**: Separate modules for different processing tasks.
- **Customizable Pipelines**: Create and modify processing pipelines to suit specific needs.
- **Interoperability**: Compatible with existing AI frameworks and toolchains.

For detailed architecture information, please refer to the [Architecture Document](docs/architecture.md).
